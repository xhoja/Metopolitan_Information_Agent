# M.I.A — Metropolitan Information Agent

> AI-Powered University Management System

*Advanced Software Engineering — Group Project*

---

## Overview

M.I.A (Metropolitan Information Agent) is a full-stack web application that serves as a complete university management system. It provides three distinct portals for administrators, professors, and students — each tailored to their specific needs and responsibilities.

The standout feature is **M.I.A**, an AI-powered academic adviser integrated exclusively into the student portal, giving students instant, personalised answers about their academic journey.

The system covers every aspect of university operations including a finance module built beyond the original project scope, making it a near-complete institutional platform built for real-world use.

---

## The Problem We Solve

- Students lack instant access to personalised academic guidance without waiting for adviser appointments
- Administrators have no unified platform to manage users, roles, and institutional data
- Professors juggle multiple tools to manage courses, grades, attendance, and assignments
- University data is fragmented across disconnected systems with no single source of truth

---

## Features

### Public Pages
- **Home page** — Landing page introducing M.I.A and the university portal
- **Login page** — Role-based authentication that redirects each user to their correct dashboard

### Administrator Dashboard
- Create and manage all user accounts (students and professors)
- Assign and update user roles across the system
- Full system oversight — access to all records, courses, and activity
- **Finance management** *(beyond original scope)* — configure tuition fees per major, auto-assign fee records and installment plans to students, record payments and track settlement status

### Professor Dashboard
- Upload and manage courses and course materials
- Record and update student grades
- Track and manage student attendance
- Create and manage assignments and projects
- Enroll students and manage class rosters

### Student Dashboard
- View current courses and enrolled subjects
- Check grades and GPA in real time
- View attendance records per course
- Access and download academic transcript
- View and submit assignments and projects
- **Finance tab** *(beyond original scope)* — view tuition fee balance, installment schedule, payment status, and transaction history
- **M.I.A AI Adviser** — Conversational AI that answers academic questions, recommends courses, checks graduation progress, and remembers student preferences

### M.I.A — AI Agent *(Student Portal Only)*

The AI agent is powered by Groq or Gemini API and is exclusively available to students. It provides:

- Natural language answers to academic questions
- Personalised course recommendations based on major and progress
- Graduation timeline and credit hour tracking
- Persistent memory of student preferences and goals across sessions
- Context-aware multi-turn conversation with full chat history

## Out of Scope

The following was originally excluded from M.I.A but a **basic finance module was added beyond the defined project scope** as an extension:

**Implemented (extra):**
- Tuition fee configuration per major
- Auto-assignment of fee records and installment plans to students
- Payment recording and settlement tracking (admin-side only)
- Student finance view — balance, installments, transactions

**Not implemented:**
- Scholarship management — no partial fee waivers, scholarship applications, or grant tracking
- Online payment gateway — payments are recorded manually by admin; no card/bank integration
- Invoice/receipt generation — no downloadable PDF documents

These may be considered for a future release.
